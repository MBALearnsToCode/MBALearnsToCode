# A Non-Traditional MBA's Mid-point Look-back

_2015-09-24_

A little over a year ago, my wife Sarah, our little friend Antoni and I made a series of trips
from Singapore &ndash; where Sarah'd lived for 10 years and I'd 6, and where Antoni was born in February 2014 &ndash;
to our homes in Viet Nam, and ultimately to Chicago via a 27-hour set of flights
on which 6-month-old Antoni helpfully fixed fellow passengers' jet lags by simply not letting them sleep.

And, _boy_, where, and how has all that year gone? Before I felt like I was anywhere near ready,
[Chicago Booth](http://www.ChicagoBooth.edu) moved me to its 2nd-Year MBAs list,
with the school's huge academic buffet feast of brain-hurting classes starting again this very morning.
On the family front, Sarah and I are expecting another baby boss within less than six months,
and hence picturing another tsunami of grueling hard work smashing at us.

So, in the one year now well past, besides acquiring Chicagoan/American tastes such as
sit-on-the-grass outdoor classical/jazz concerts, thousand-mile scenic drives, and apartments that I'd think be enough
for 10 of us back in Singapore, what have I managed to get done? This blog gives you a year-in-the-life-of-mine
little peep.

## Being a diligent schoolboy again

A irrepressible yearning for going back to school was the reason
I left [CapitaMalls Asia](http://www.CapitaMallsAsia.com), a great employer who nurtured my early career
through a dozen fruitful roles in my 6 years with the company.
And once I found myself a schoolboy again, I tried to make the most of the chance.


<a name="OnlineCourses"></a>

### Online Courses

Before starting at Booth, I took a plethora of **online courses** on [Coursera.com](http://www.Coursera.com),
eventually completing a dozen of them. What excited me the most were Coursera's excellent offerings in
**Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Robotics** and general
**Data Science** and **Computer Science**.

I'd already taught myself to code in 3-4 computer languages and built a solid foundation in Data Science 
through my last 3 years at CapitaMalls, during which I worked on building several Analytics systems to mine
the company's increasingly sizeable and commercially important trove of Leasing, Marketing and Operations data.
But what Coursera did a tremendous job in was helping me gain a fully up-to-date picture of
where these exciting fields were heading in terms of really advanced technological applications.

_Machine Learning involves some hair-raising math:_

<a name="RatInSackOfRice"></a>

### Chicago Booth and UChicago courses

At Booth, I found myself a fish in the water &ndash; or, as we say it in an equivalent Oriental metaphor,
_"a rat in a sack of rice"_ &ndash; with **the school's enormous and uber-flexible curriculum offerings**.
Not only there are uncountable exciting courses _(try counting the Finance classes, which Booth is famous for)_,
there is a _huge_ amount of freedom in crafting one's individualized learning path. By this mid-point in the program,
I've managed to complete 13 courses, 2/3 of my degree requirement, including the following highlights:

<br>

- <a name="BoothEntrepreneurship"></a>_ENTREPRENEURSHIP @ BOOTH_: **_Entrepreneurial Selling_** by serial entrepreneur
    [Craig Wortmann](http://www.ChicagoBooth.edu/faculty/directory/w/Craig-Wortmann),
    **_Entrepreneurship through Acquisition_** by Private Equity/Search Funds veterans
    [Mark Agnew](http://www.ChicagoBooth.edu/faculty/directory/a/Mark-Agnew) and
    [Brian O'Connor](http://www.ChicagoBooth.edu/faculty/directory/o/Brian-O-Connor),
    and the ultimate showdown **_New Venture Challenge Lab_** led by renowned professors
    [Steve Kaplan](http://www.ChicagoBooth.edu/faculty/directory/k/Steven-Neil-Kaplan) and
    [Ellen Rudnick](http://www.ChicagoBooth.edu/faculty/directory/r/Ellen-A-Rudnick).
    All are part of Booth's world-beating, already-awesome-and-increasing-so Entrepreneurship curriculum
    championed by the [Polsky Center](http://research.ChicagoBooth.edu/Polsky), which also runs
    an impressive [Entrepreneurship Essentials](http://CareerAdvancement.UChicago.edu/Entrepreneurship/Essentials)
    workshop series.
    
    - The _New Venture Challenge_ was certainly the most intense experience.
    I joined the lab to help out [**Keith Wagner**](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/keith-wagner/34/68/176)
    with his start-up [**Dynamic Positioning Training Solutions**](http://dptrainingsolutions.com),
    a New York-based advanced maritime technological training center.
    
        _Team [**Maestro**](http://www.maestrofood.co/maestro) topped the 2015 NVC with a smart cooking appliance
    and a Final pitch of quality bordering on pure theater:_
    
        ![](MaestroNVC.png)
    
    - In my upcoming 2nd year, I am back for more Entrep goodness in **_Building the New Venture_** by
    [Waverly Deutsch](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/d/Waverly-Deutsch)
    
    <br>
    
- <a name="UChicagoDataIntensiveCourses"></a>_DATA-INTENSIVE COURSES_ &ndash;
oodles of them available, to my heart's delight &ndash; in what is the quantitative paradises
that are Booth and UChicago. At Booth, I took **_Big Data_** by rising star
[Matt Taddy](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/t/Matt-Taddy).
    - <a name="KaggleAXA"></a>For the final project, I made a fairly creditable attempt at tackling this
    [very big and very wild driving telematics tracking data set on Kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com/c/axa-driver-telematics-analysis)
    hosted by insurance giant AXA, who challenged Kaggle competitors to detect individual driving styles from
    high-frequency series of location coordinates streamed from vehicle-mounted accelerometers.
    Below were plots showing individual drivers' highly characteristic
    accelerating and turning behaviors detected by my pattern-recognition algorithms:
    
    ![](KaggleAXADrivingStyles.png)
    
    <br>
    
    Another quant must-try was **_Machine Learning & Large-Scale Data Analysis_**
by UChicago's leading Machine Learning guru [John Lafferty](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~lafferty)
(more on him [below](#JohnLafferty)). His course was a sweeping survey with head-cracking math and
literally astronomical data sets _(e.g. characteristic light curves from dozens of thousands of planets and stars)_.

    _Lafferty's homework featured undoubtedly astronomical data transmitted from the Kepler space telescope:_

    ![](JohnLaffertyMLLSDA_AstroData.png)
    
    <br>

- <a name="UChicagoScienceAndTechCourses"></a>_SCIENCE / TECH COURSES_ in UChicago:
Booth's flexible curriculum enables me to try out great offerings elsewhere at UChicago's
diverse departments and member research institutions. 
My hands-down favorite was **_Robotics & Artificial Intelligence_** by
[Matt Walter](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~mwalter),
a UIUC- and MIT-trained roboticist and one of the builders of the MIT Self-Driving Car, which
finished in the top 5 in [DARPA's famous 2007 Urban Challenge](http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge).

    - <a name="RoboSoccer"></a>My final Robotics programming project, perfectly timed shortly before the European (Soccer) Cup final,
    was this [**RoboSoccer game**](http://www.Facebook.com/LuongTheVinh/videos/vb.36917371/10101310626436280/?type=2&theater),
    employing an algorithm called _"Extended Kalman Filter-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping" (EKF SLAM)_.
    Here is my [**entire paper** on this game](RoboSoccer.pdf) for your reading pleasure.
    
        _My bots basically locate and orient themselves on the field by estimating their distances from various landmarks,
    e.g. goal posts and corner flags; they then try chase the pink ball and kick it towards the goal.

        _But that triumphal end only came after I barely survived
        this below sad, sick, total-terror Robo reading list,
        which is written in as many Greek symbols as English characters..._
        
        ![](RoboticsReadings.png)
    
        <br>
    
    I also got a taste of **_Computer Vision_** by
[Sam Armato](http://radiology.uchicago.edu/directory/Samuel-Armato-III) and
[Maryellen Giger](http://radiology.uchicago.edu/directory/Maryellen-L-Giger),
seasoned scientists who have been spending many decades developing
automated visual analysis technologies for advanced medical equipment.
    
    - <a name="DroneVisualInspection"></a>I presented a brief paper outlining my thoughts on
    how the same Computer Vision techniques may be used by drones to
    automate visual inspection of mechanical faults in highly hazardous environments,
    _e.g._ near oil or natural gas pipelines
    
    <br>
    
    _Because both profs are medical doctors, they gave us this chest X-ray
    to play around with in mathematical / scientific ways, for 10 weeks...
    Hey, why not a real-, fleshy-chest photo to motivate students better??_
    
    ![](ChestXRay.jpg)

    _To their credit, when they were in a more chilled-out, non-medical-doctorial mood, they sometimes used
    this [**iconic, super-motivating "Lenna" (Söderberg) photo**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna)
    in illustrating their Comp Vision algorithms (e.g. analyzing how differently her smooth skin and her hat's
    non-smooth fur turn out in the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) frequency domain, etc.):_
    
    ![](Lenna.png)


<br>

- <a name="AnalyticStrategyAndPractice"></a>_ANALYTIC STRATEGY & PRACTICE_:
I attended **_Modern Analytic Strategy and Practice_** by [Bob Grossman](http://rgrossman.com),
a UChicago professor, Data Analytics veteran, and inventor of several high-performance data technologies.
This course painted a sobering picture explaining why, and how, numerous Analytics executives, teams, projects,
M&As, and organizations fail &ndash; and pointed out highly practical remedies.
    
    - <a name="McDonaldsAnalytics"></a>For the final project, my teammates and I took a look at
    Analytics at McDonald's and its service providers, seeing how advanced number-crunching is done
    on vast &ndash; _really vast_ &ndash; amounts of data on anything countable,
    from distribution centers and transportation costs, to daily inventories of beef burgers, chicken nuggets
    and the uber-popular _Despicable Me_ minion toys...

<br>  
  
- <a name="BoothAppDev"></a>_APP DEVELOPMENT_: Thanks to sheer amounts of hard work by my great pals over at
[Booth Hacks](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/programs/full-time/student-experience/beyond-classroom/groups/Booth-Hacks),
who trial-ran an 8-week proof-of-concept web development course in 2013-2014,
Booth now has a always-sold-out **_App Development_** course wonderfully taught by
[Raghu Betina](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/b/Raghu-Betina),
a course that takes many initially feeble new coding hands and turns them into competent ones capable of
producing apps to track and analyze credit-card spends or to remind one to dry-clean one's clothes, _etc._
    
    - I successfully built 2 apps over the 2015 summer, dedicating them to my wife Sarah
    (basically using her free labor to beta-test them for me).


<a name="MeetingFamousComputerScientistsAndStatisticians"></a>

## Meeting world-beating Computer Scientists / Statisticians

Bumping into world-famous quant people at UChicago is as easy as seeing movie stars walking around in Hollywood.
I have so far met:

- <a name="GeoffHinton">[**GEOFF HINTON**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton)</a>,
of UToronto and Google, a towering Machine Learning / A.I. giant of our time and one of the chieftains of the
[Deep Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) "[Canadian Mafia](http://recode.net/2015/07/15/ai-conspiracy-the-scientists-behind-deep-learning)".
I've met him not just once, but **thrice**,
at his distinguished guest lectures at [UChicago's Totoya Tech Institute](http://www.ttic.edu).
We two are actually **fellow alumni of Cambridge University, U.K.** _(yay!)_.
He shook my hand once &ndash; only after a considerable pause of hesitation &ndash;
and then told me that, as a business student looking to exploit his algorithms for monetary gains,
I should really pay to sit there. But I think he doesn't hate me, or care enough to do so.
    
    _Hinton the intellectual giant prefers to keep himself small,
    here delivering his lecture from the very corner of the room,
    avoiding the limelight: (work your eyes a bit to really see him)_
    
    ![](HintonLecture.png)

- <a name="JohnLafferty">[**JOHN LAFFERTY**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Lafferty)</a>,
who founded the world's first Machine Learning department at Carnegie Mellon University,
and then joined UChicago &ndash; _with an O.K.-plus moving package, for sure_ &ndash; to make us great.
You'll find him really gentle, approachable, fatherly and utterly likeable,
until he actually throws some painful, daddy's-tough-love, hard-rock math at you.
Notwithstanding its difficult-to-chew reputation,
his signature course **_Machine Learning & Large-Scale Data Analysis_** invariably attracts a crazily-crowded,
diverse, rock-concert-like audience, with students sitting elbow-to-elbow on chairs, more students sitting on the floor,
and yet more students peeping from outside the door, like so:

- <a name="MikeJordan">[**MICHAEL JORDAN**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_I._Jordan)</a>,
not of Chicago Bulls but rather of UC Berkeley. He came to give a guest lecture on some
highly performant algorithms to deal with really big data, in a session also fully-attended
to the firemen's discomfort.
    
    _Apparently, to fully appreciate Jordan's math and analyses, one must sometimes trade off some valuable hair:_
    
    ![](MikeJordanLecture.png)


<a name="AllThingsMachineLearning"></a>

## All things Machine Learning

During Booth's Orientation, when I told my dear classmates I was into **Machine Learning**, **A.I.** and **Robotics**,
a few pointed me to a wall at Harper Center, where there is a neon contemporary artwork saying (asking?)
in a kinda dark, haunting way:

![](WhyAreYouHere.jpg)

When I came over to UChicago's Computer Science and Statistics departments to attend lectures and talks,
and told folks there I was from the b-school, I received identical reception &ndash;
_i.e._, "_Why [the hell] are you here??!_".

Needless to say, my academic and professional paths during this past year have been anything but standard.
I missed out on a few staples of the MBA life, such as on-campus recruiting, and wandered further afield from
Booth's Harper Center to spend time at UChicago's various mathematical and technological institutions,
seeking exotic non-MBA classes.

But I have also ploughed much of my wayward learnings back to Booth,
trying to **make Machine Learning happen at Booth**, to bring its cutting-edge benefits
to the context of modern business operations and management.
And in doing so, I have received warm reception and encouragement from many classmates and faculty members
in Booth's open, curious and progressive academic environment.


<a name="TrialMachineLearningClasses"></a>

### Trial Machine Learning classes for Booth MBA friends

In late November 2014, I reached out to invite some Booth friends to try out a 4-week Machine Learning crash course,
focusing on [**Predictive Analytics and Pattern Recognition using Neural Networks**](NeuralNetworksForPatternRecognition.pdf).
I got lots of help from my long-time pals [**Kathy Le**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lenguyenphuongthikathy)
and her husband [**Khoi Nguyen**](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/khoi-nguyen/52/963/762) _(give a shout-out to 'em!)_
to organize 3-hour Saturday-afternoon classes at Park Millennium's business center. They even volunteered their TV
for me to present my materials, as Park Mill's TV was very broken.

8 friends joined at the beginning, and 5 went all the way to finish this experimental course.
We used a Matlab programming package I'd been coding up for 8 months to run demos on classic
Machine Learning / Neural Networks use cases in **optical character recognition** (**OCR**).
My friends brought home real, serious homework with **multiple-choice questions**, **write-up questions**,
a case study on **Google's self-driving cars**, and **Matlab programming assignments**.
The course culminated in a \*\*\***high-adrenalin live final competition**\*\*\* in which
everyone was given 90 minutes to build a Neural Network to rate the quality of bicep curls,
on data collected from fitness tracking devices.

_Machine Learning class finalists:
[**Khoi Nguyen**](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/khoi-nguyen/52/963/762),

<a name="BoothMachineLearning"></a>

### FOR-REAL, for-credit Machine Learning course for Booth MBAs &ndash; _WORLD's FIRST of Its Kind!!_

Shortly after I completed the above trial Machine Learning course for my friends with a happy ending,
I happened to hear from a Machine Learning PhD friend that Booth had just very recently recruited
a young prof named [**Mladen Kolar**](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/k/Mladen-Kolar),
who got his Machine Learning PhD from hot-house Carnegie Mellon and who was a [**1st-batch receiver
the Facebook Fellowship**](http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/announcing-the-inaugural-facebook-fellows/381538997130).
I immediately fired out an email to Mladen, in a prudently formal-enough tone, but translatable roughly to
_"**You're an ML expert... that's cool... and you decided to join Booth... incredible... no way!... WE. MUST. MEET**!!"_

We met face-to-face in his office right before the winter holiday break, and I shared with him
the excitement and good feedback from my friends whom I'd been teaching Machine Learning to,
and exchanged thoughts on how we could generalize such feedback to a real demand by Booth MBAs,
many of whom are very quant-oriented, for getting our heads around Machine Learning / A.I. and
becoming effective business executives in our subsequent careers when we would inevitably have to deal with
advanced Data Analytics and technologies powered by Machine Learning algorithms.

We had a couple of further follow-up brain-storming discussions, and then one fine day in Spring 2015,
Mladen informed me that he had successfully worked his magic within what is a very open, progressive
and innovative Chicago Booth curriculum-planning system, and <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
**there will indeed be a Machine Learning course specificially tailored to Booth MBAs**</span>
starting September 2015 &ndash;
the <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">**very first in the world of its kind**</span>
in the curricula of the leading U.S. and international business schools that we know of!!
Senior professor [**Rob McCulloch**](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/m/Robert-E-McCulloch)
and Mladen would co-teach the course, which would feature contents hitherto alien to a b-school audience,
including but certainly not limited to:

- _Ensemble modeling methods such as Random Forests / Boosting / Bagging,_
- _Neural Networks / a primer on Deep Learning,_
- _Recommendation Engines,_
- _Anomaly Detection in high-dimensional data, and_
- _Probabilistic Graphical Models._

The new offering proved popular with Booth's quant-thirsty populace, with about 100 MBAs signing up.
Mladen and I labored over the summer to build this
[**shiny website for the course**](http://chicagoboothml.github.io/MachineLearning_Fall2015),
and with my fellow Booth MBA [**Juan Yrigoyen**](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jyrigoyen)
_(Big Data fanatic and a summer data-cruncher at Amazon)_ and UChicago Econ PhD
[**Dan Hedblom**](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/daniel-hedblom/2/332/b07)
also joining the course staff, we got ready to start rocking-and-rolling at
**Eight-Thirty AM, Today, September the Twenty-Forth, Twenty-Fifteen**.

_Picture from D-Day:_


<a name="Uptake"></a>

### Data Scientist / Analytics Product Architect @ disruptive Industrial Internet-of-Things Analytics start-up Uptake, LLC

In late October 2014, barely a month into my MBA program, I saw a two-and-a-half line advertisement about
a Chicago-based analytics start-up named [**Uptake**](http://uptake.com), written by COO **John Ciasulli**,
a newly-minted 2014 Booth grad and a VC at [Lightbank](http://www.lightbank.com),
on our Entrepreneurship & Venture Capital group's newsletter.
John wrote that Uptake was seeking to use advanced Machine Learning to enhance the efficiency of
massive heavy industrial machinery such as freight locomotives and mining trucks,
which sounded really awesome real-world use cases to me.

I speculatively emailed John expressing my interest in knowing more, and was delighted when he invited me
over "for coffee" a couple of days later. I did have some nice, strong coffee _(2 cups)_,
and we talked a great deal about what predictive tasks are involved in automating industrial processes,
and also about the cool quant classes at Booth. John, a Berkeley-trained engineer by background, is himself a fervent
data miner and Kaggle.com competitor.

John emailed me a part-time job offer 2 hours after our coffee chat,
and with the magical administrative ultra-efficiency that only Booth's Academic Services director
**Christine Gramhopfer** can pull off, less than a week later I got my work authorization
and found myself at a shared desk at Uptake.

- _That was as much of summer internship recruiting as I ever did &ndash; 2 cups of coffee &ndash;
because my part-time role kept getting extended subsequently, all the way until **yesterday, 2015-09-23**
(the very day before school restarts!)_

Working at a fast-growing start-up was like nothing I'd ever done.
When I started in late November, the company was a few months old and had over two dozen employees.
I joined **Mike Horrell** and **Zac Schaefer**, Stats PhD and MSc from UChicago,
in the initial Data Science setup. We quickly found ourselves swimming in seas of real-world,
not-so-pretty to outright-nasty data sets transmitted from a an overwhelming number of industrial sensors
measuring all thinkable kinds of temperatures, pressures, fuel-consumption rates, payload weights,
throttle power, wheel rotational speeds, oil and water and coolant levels, _etc. etc. etc._,
from mammoth-sized locomotives and mining trucks built by Caterpillar Inc., Uptake's first client. 


_A close-up of an engine of a CAT freight locomotive below.
There are easily 150-300 sensors hidden all over the place and spitting out Big Data from all that Big Iron._

![](CATLocomotiveEngine.jpg)


_CAT builds some truly massive mining trucks &ndash; the kind that roam around Aussie mines
bringing up metal ores and coal to satisfy the Chinese dragon's thirst for energy and raw materials.
The story goes that **some trucks are so so gigantic that they even have in-built washrooms** &ndash;
because by the time you manage to walk out of one of those trucks
keeping fully compliant with proper industrial safety rules,
your urgent piece of "business" will be very much done.
Also, by the way, when those wheels roll, be very sure to keep good distance!!_

![](CATMiningTruck.jpg)


In my total of 10 months at Uptake, my main task / specialty was developing **scalable and performant
Anomaly Detection algorithms to monitor the health conditions of such data-rich equipment**.
All kinds of theory that I'd acquired through school, through online courses, _etc._, became vividly alive.
I was no longer doing a piece of homework for a good grade, but wrestling with real, messy data
and trying to get the best possible predictions and recommendations out of those data
in an acceptable live run-time to enable people to make informed and timely operating decisions.
The **cost, in terms of unplanned expenses and lost business,
of a big piece of machinery not getting maintained when it should**, or conversely,
**getting idled for maintenance when it is actually healthy**, stands in the order of
**hundreds of thousands of dollars per asset, per time**.

### Some Poker fun with Machine Learning @ Argonne National Lab / Computation Institute hackathon final

Now, onto something more light-hearted, but still involving Machine Learning.

In late November 2014, the [**Computation Institute**](http://www.ci.uchicago.edu),
a joint UChicago-[**Argonne National Lab**](http://www.anl.gov) research house,
hosted a data hackathon, with the top prize being a brand new 3D printer!
With so much other work going on at the same time, I attended not for really competing for anything,
but mainly to meet other data pals in UChicago and see what they were up to.

The Final night featured a diverse array of quickly-hacked-together tools targeting at big problems
from crime tracking to health solutions provider recommendation (the latter by Booth's own
pre-eminent hacker [**Jake Walker**](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jake-walker/19/b/2b1), ex-Google / ex-Microsoft,
Co-Founder of the awesome aforementioned [Booth Hacks](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/programs/full-time/student-experience/beyond-classroom/groups/Booth-Hacks),
and now Co-Founder and CTO of built-at-Booth start-up [**Lumii Health**](https://www.LumiiHealth.com)).

I chipped in with some entertainment by presenting a Neural Network that has been trained
to recognize the [**poker hands**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands) &ndash;
_Pair_, _Two Pairs_, _Three of a Kind_, _Straight_, _Flush_, _Full House_, _Four of a Kind_ and _Straight Flush_ &ndash;
to a high level of accuracy. The exercise was mainly for fun, but also illustrated the challenges of
"**skewed classes**" in training Machine Learning models. A _Straight Flush_ hand, for instance, is
about 30,000 times rarer than a lame _Pair_, and simplistic algorithms may run for centuries without ever
figuring out the _Straight Flush_. Poker is a fun way to study this difficult challenge.

## Birth of Booth Analytics Club

Besides Booth's wondering quant academic offerings, another factor that made me feel a fish in the water
(or _"a rat in a sack of rice"_, as we say it in where I come from)
at Booth is being surrounded by many classmates that share the same passions
for data and numbers, and who are excited about the applications of modern Data Analytics in today's business.

Through Orientation and various classes and meet-ups, I got to know
[**Sahil Bahri**](http://www.linkedin.com/in/BahriSahil),
[**Juan Yrigoyen**](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jyrigoyen),
[**Kevin Lam**](http://www.linkedin.com/in/KevinKaeLam),
[**Jaya Kandaswamy**](http://www.linkedin.com/in/JKanda), and
[**Amanda Collins**](http://www.linkedin.com/in/Amanda0Collins),
and who shared the view that Data Analytics had now become a crucial profession
cutting across multiple industries, and that industries now demanded greater and greater
Analytics mastery from business executives than ever before.
With Booth's and UChicago's rich quant tradition, it was time to
build at Booth a strong student community around Data Analytics in Business,
so that we Booth MBAs could go out to various industries and play to our core quant strengths.

With great guidance from our seniors [**Andrew Edelman**](http://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewedelman)
and [**Rafi Nulman**](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rafi-nulman/a/457/210),
who'd already laid some valuable ground work the year before, we coordinated with Booth's program officers
to formally launch [**Booth Analytics Club**](http://groups.chicagobooth.edu/Analytics/home) in early 2015.

Our Club is still young and we have tons of things to have to do going forward,
but we are elated with how fast the membership base has been expanding,
with the total now standing at about 100 members across Booth's
Full-Time, Evening and Weekend MBA programs.

We have so far organized:

- 2 Lunch-and-Learn panels on **_Analytics in Modern Business_** and **_Surviving Analytics Internships_**,
- A guest lecture on **_Analytics onboard Self-Driving Cars_**,
by who else but my Robotics prof [Matt Walter](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~mwalter),
- A talk on **_Analytics at IBM_**, and
- A cosy summer get-together.

We have also spent weeks and months to construct this wide-ranging
[**Data Science Learning Resources Catalog**](http://tinyurl.com/ChicagoBoothAnalytics-DataSci).

In the pipeline for the upcoming Fall-Winter 2015 are:

- SQL and Data Visualization crash courses,
- A Data Science in Python workshop series, and
- A Data Science Career Resources Catalog.

Booth Analytics Nation, watch out for those exciting things coming! <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>

## What on earth did **_MBALearnsToCode_** learn to code?

At the expense of upsetting my wife Sarah multiple times with coding-induced absent-mindedness,
and of being guilty of playing with my son Antoni a bit less than I should have done,
I now look back to my one year's worth of output of digital nothings with a (pained) smile.

Among many other coding activities, I have:

- Been building a dozen Machine Learning and related Python programming packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI),
- Through Booth's **_App Development_** course, acquired super-essential
**HTML**, **CSS** and **SQL databasing** skills,
- Picked up **Django**, a great software development framework in my favorite language Python
    - Built **2 Django apps** dedicated to Sarah _(to nudge her to beta-test for me in her free time)_;
    maybe, one day, either of those would go on to fetch $1 billion or some cool amount in that order of magnitude
        - we won't mind if it could fetch only $100 mil
            - we'll still be super-happy if one goes for $10 mil
                - we'll be reasonably pleased with $1 mil also
                    - we'll not feel bad if it could barely pay back enough for my MBA tuition
                        - actually, we'll be just fine so long as my incessant digital-nothing venturing
                         does not burn a hole in our savings accounts
                         to the point I'd have to sell my clothes and get kicked out by my family
- Deepened by relationship with &ndash; _i.e., digging deeper into my pocket to pay for_ &ndash;
**Amazon Web Services** such as **EC2**, **Elastic Beanstalk**, **RDS**, **Route 53** and **S3**.
    - I feel good about now being a meaningful driver of their mother company's less negative net profit
- Built Booth's
[**Machine Learning course website**](http://chicagoboothml.github.io/MachineLearning_Fall2015), and
- Built this very **_MBALearnsToCode.me_** website!

This year's tentative learning deliverables include:

- more familiarity with **Julia** and **Scala**,
- more **Theano**, **Numba** and **Apache Spark**,
- **NoSQL databases** / **ElasticSearch**, and
- **JavaScript**.

Look at **whose name is credited** as the winner at the corner of that print-out.

That's _not_ stealing &ndash; I got the deserved credit for marrying the right one,
who, among many things else, takes awesome photos like that!

Life was, and is, good! <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
