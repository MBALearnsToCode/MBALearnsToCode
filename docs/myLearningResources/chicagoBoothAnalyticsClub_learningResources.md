# **Data Science Learning Resources** by Chicago Booth Analytics Club

**Chicago Booth Analytics Club**, which I co-founded in early 2015, maintains and constantly updates a uber-comprehensive [**wiki**](https://github.com/ChicagoBoothAnalytics/site/wiki), which includes a dizzying array of Booth, UChicago and online courses you can take.
 
Happy Learning! <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
