# **Data Science Learning Resources** by Chicago Booth Analytics Club

[Chicago Booth Analytics Club](https://groups.chicagobooth.edu/analytics), which I co-founded in early 2015, maintains and constantly updates a uber-comprehensive [**Data Science Learning Resources Catalog**](http://tinyurl.com/ChicagoBoothAnalytics-DataSci).

Huge buckets of sweat have been shed to compile this awesome catalog, and we figure we'd do much good to the world by opening it up for everyone interested to see. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
