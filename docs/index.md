## *Eine kleine* Icebreaker

Hi there. :)

By day, I am **Vinh**, a dizzily-busy, multitaskingly-distracted, overly-committed full-time MBA student at Chicago Booth and young dad with a toddling little boss.

Come the quiet of the night, and I turn into **`mbaLearnsToCode`**, furiously *committing* (word pun totally intended) snippets of computer programming code to my repositories of precious digital nothings on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/mbaLearnsToCode), [**BitBucket**](https://bitbucket.org/MBALearnsToCode) and the [**Python Package Index (PyPI)**](https://pypi.python.org).

I code so that I can:

* bask myself in the inevitable new world of **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence** and **Robotics**, and

* build little **life-quality-enhancing apps** to help my wife, myself - plus, *ahem*, friends who are good to us - less busy doing mind-numbing things such as clearing emails, managing calendars or tracking receipts.

My [**coding repertoire**](myRepertoire/) includes:

* Python / Django
* R
* Matlab / Octave
* Julia
* Ruby / Rails
* SQL
* Pascal *(does anyone know this language anymore??)*, and
* a bunch of cloud-computing stuff such as EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, Route 53 and S3 by Amazon Web Services *(whose parent company stays afloat probably thanks to my monthly bills)*.


## What's Cool Here?

* My [**Blogs**](blogs/_whats_in_here), documenting my high and low moments as 

* My [**Learning Resources**](learningResources/_whats_in_here) to help you if you are starting, or co-travelling, the same MBA-coder path as I am; these includes:

    - a jaw-droppingly comprehensive [**Data Science Learning Resources Catalog**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SJFxanYga2V7lLLk3XZcY5ly_T32mfgMcNRb2VMfDOs) compiled by the people, for the people of the young but almightily awesome [Chicago Booth Analytics Club](https://groups.chicagobooth.edu/analytics), which I co-founded in early 2015; and
    
    - general app-development tips

* My [**Tool Room**](toolRoom/_whats_in_here), where I painstakingly catalog useful magic-weapon-like programming packages that coders like you and I can steal for free and summon when we have our backs against the wall (or are banging our heads against one in frustration)

Enjoy your time on my site! :)
