Before I felt like I was anywhere near ready,\n\nChicago Booth\n moved me to its 2nd-Year MBAs list,\nwith the school's huge academic buffet feast of brain-hurting classes starting again this very morning.\nOn the family front, Sarah and I are expecting another baby boss within less than six months,\nand hence picturing another tsunami of grueling hard work smashing at us.\n\n\nSo, in the one year now well past, besides acquiring Chicagoan/American tastes such as\nsit-on-the-grass outdoor classical/jazz concerts, thousands of miles of scenic drives,\nand apartments that I'd think be enough for 10 of us back in Singapore,\nwhat have I managed to get done?

What excited me the most were Coursera's excellent offerings in\n\nMachine Learning\n, \nArtificial Intelligence\n, \nRobotics\n and general\n\nData Science\n and \nComputer Science\n.\n\n\nI'd already taught myself to code in 3-4 computer languages and built a solid foundation in Data Science \nthrough my last 3 years at CapitaMalls, during which I worked on building several Analytics systems to mine\nthe company's increasingly sizeable and commercially important trove of Leasing, Marketing and Operations data.\nBut what Coursera did a tremendous job in was helping me gain a fully up-to-date picture of\nwhere these exciting fields were heading in terms of really advanced technological applications.\n\n\nMachine Learning involves some hair-raising math:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicago Booth and UChicago courses\n\n\nAt Booth, I found myself a fish in the water \n or, as we say it in an equivalent Oriental metaphor,\n\n\"a rat in a sack of rice\"\n \n with \nthe school's enormous and uber-flexible curricular offerings\n.\nNot only there are uncountable exciting courses \n(try counting the Finance classes, for which Booth is famous)\n,\nthere is a \nhuge\n amount of freedom in crafting one's individualized learning path. By this mid-point in the program,\nI've managed to complete 13 courses, 2/3 of my degree requirement, including the following highlights:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENTREPRENEURSHIP @ BOOTH\n: \nEntrepreneurial Selling\n by serial entrepreneur\n    \nCraig Wortmann\n,\n    \nEntrepreneurship through Acquisition\n by Private Equity/Search Funds veterans\n    \nMark Agnew\n and\n    \nBrian O'Connor\n,\n    and the ultimate showdown \nNew Venture Challenge Lab\n led by renowned professors\n    \nSteve Kaplan\n and\n    \nEllen Rudnick\n.\n    All are part of Booth's world-beating, already-awesome-and-increasing-so Entrepreneurship curriculum\n    championed by the \nPolsky Center\n, which also runs\n    an impressive \nEntrepreneurship Essentials\n\n    workshop series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nNew Venture Challenge\n was certainly the most intense experience.\nI joined the lab to help out \nKeith Wagner\n\nwith his start-up \nDynamic Positioning Training Solutions\n,\na New York-based advanced maritime technological training center.\n\n\nTeam \nMaestro\n topped the 2015 NVC with a smart cooking appliance\n    and a Final pitch of stylishness and meticulous execution bordering on pure theater:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my upcoming 2nd year, I am back for more Entrep goodness in \nBuilding the New Venture\n by\n\nWaverly Deutsch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATA-INTENSIVE COURSES\n \n\noodles of them available, to my heart's delight \n in what is the quantitative paradises\nthat are Booth and UChicago. At Booth, I took \nBig Data\n by rising star\n\nMatt Taddy\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor the final project, I made a fairly creditable attempt at tackling this\n\nvery big and very wild driving telematics tracking data set on Kaggle.com\n\nhosted by insurance giant AXA, who challenged Kaggle competitors to detect individual driving styles from\nhigh-frequency series of location coordinates streamed from vehicle-mounted accelerometers.\nBelow were plots showing individual drivers' highly characteristic\naccelerating and turning behaviors detected by my pattern-recognition algorithms:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother quant must-try was \nMachine Learning \n Large-Scale Data Analysis\n\nby UChicago's leading Machine Learning guru \nJohn Lafferty\n\n(more on him \nbelow\n). His course was a sweeping survey with head-cracking math and\nliterally astronomical data sets \n(e.g. characteristic light curves from dozens of thousands of planets and stars)\n.\n\n\nLafferty's homework featured undoubtedly astronomical data transmitted from the Kepler space telescope:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIENCE / TECH COURSES\n in UChicago:\nBooth's flexible curriculum enables me to try out great offerings elsewhere at UChicago's\ndiverse departments and member research institutions. \nMy hands-down favorite was \nRobotics \n Artificial Intelligence\n by\n\nMatt Walter\n,\na UIUC- and MIT-trained roboticist and one of the builders of the MIT Self-Driving Car, which\nfinished in the top 5 in \nDARPA's famous 2007 Urban Challenge\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy final Robotics programming project, perfectly timed shortly before the European (Soccer) Cup final,\nwas this \nRoboSoccer game\n,\nemploying an algorithm called \n\"Extended Kalman Filter-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\" (EKF SLAM)\n.\nHere is my \nentire paper\n on this game\n for your reading pleasure.\n\n\nMy bots basically locate and orient themselves on the field by estimating their distances from various landmarks,\n    e.g. goal posts and corner flags; they then try chase the pink ball and kick it towards the goal.\n    \nCLICK\n\n    the below image to see a live match:\n\n\n\n\nBut that triumphal end only came after I barely survived\nthis below sad, sick, total-terror Robo reading list,\nwhich is written in as many Greek symbols as English characters...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also got a taste of \nComputer Vision\n from\n\nSam Armato\n and\n\nMaryellen Giger\n,\nseasoned scientists who have been spending many decades developing\nautomated visual analysis technologies for advanced medical equipment.\n\n\n\n\nI presented a brief paper outlining my thoughts on\nhow the same Computer Vision techniques may be used by drones to\nautomate visual inspection of mechanical faults in highly hazardous environments,\n\ne.g.\n near oil or natural gas pipelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause both profs are medical doctors, they gave us this chest X-ray\nto play around with in mathematical / scientific ways, for 10 weeks...\nHey, why not a real-, fleshy-chest photo to motivate students better??\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, when they were in a more chilled-out, non-medical-doctorial mood, they sometimes used\nthis \nultra-iconic \"Lenna\" (S\u00f6derberg) photo\n\nin illustrating their Comp Vision algorithms (e.g. analyzing how differently her smooth skin and her hat's\nnon-smooth fur turn out in the Fourier frequency domain, etc.):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANALYTIC STRATEGY \n PRACTICE\n:\nI attended \nModern Analytic Strategy and Practice\n by \nBob Grossman\n,\na UChicago professor, Data Analytics veteran, and inventor of several high-performance data technologies.\nThis course painted a sobering picture explaining why, and how, numerous Analytics executives, teams, projects,\nM\nAs, and organizations fail \n and pointed out highly practical remedies.\n\n\n\n\nFor the final project, my teammates and I took a look at\nAnalytics at McDonald's and its service providers, seeing how advanced number-crunching is done\non vast \n \nreally vast\n \n amounts of data on anything countable,\nfrom distribution centers and transportation costs, to daily inventories of beef burgers, chicken nuggets\nand the uber-popular \nDespicable Me\n minion toys...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPP DEVELOPMENT\n: Thanks to sheer amounts of hard work by my great pals over at\n\nBooth Hacks\n,\nwho trial-ran an 8-week proof-of-concept web development course in 2013-2014,\nBooth now has a always-sold-out \nApp Development\n course wonderfully taught by\n\nRaghu Betina\n,\na course that takes many initially feeble new coding hands and turns them into competent ones capable of\nproducing apps to track and analyze credit-card spends or to remind one to dry-clean one's clothes, \netc.\n\n\n\n\nI successfully built 2 apps over the 2015 summer, dedicating them to my wife Sarah\n\n(essentially to use her free labor to beta-test them for me)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting world-beating Computer Scientists / Statisticians\n\n\nBumping into world-famous quant people at UChicago is as easy as seeing movie stars walking around in Hollywood.\nI have so far met:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGEOFF HINTON\n,\nof UToronto and Google, a towering Machine Learning / A.I. giant of our time and one of the chieftains of the\n\nDeep Learning\n \"\nCanadian Mafia\n\".\nI've met him not just once, but \nthrice\n,\nat his distinguished guest lectures at \nUChicago's Totoya Tech Institute\n.\nWe two are actually \nfellow alumni of Cambridge University, U.K.\n \n(yay!)\n.\nHe shook my hand once \n only after a considerable pause of hesitation \n\nand then told me that, as a business student looking to exploit his algorithms for monetary gains,\nI should really pay to sit there. But I think he doesn't hate me, or care enough to do so.\n\n\nHinton the intellectual giant prefers to keep himself small,\nhere delivering his lecture from the very corner of the room,\navoiding the limelight: (work your eyes a bit to really see him)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJOHN LAFFERTY\n,\nwho founded the world's first Machine Learning department at Carnegie Mellon,\nand then joined UChicago \n \nwith an O.K.-plus moving package, for sure\n \n to make us great.\nYou'll find him really gentle, approachable, fatherly and utterly likeable,\nuntil he starts hurling at you loads of painful, daddy's-tough-love, this-is-not-pleasant-but-it's-good-for-you,\nrock-hard math!! Notwithstanding its difficult-to-chew reputation,\nhis signature course \nMachine Learning \n Large-Scale Data Analysis\n invariably attracts a crazily-crowded,\ndiverse, rock-concert-like following, with students sitting elbow-to-elbow on chairs,\nmore students sitting on the floor, and yet more students peeping from outside the door...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMICHAEL JORDAN\n,\nnot the Chicago Bulls basketballer but rather the UC Berkeley machine-learner.\nHe came to give a guest lecture on some highly performant algorithms to deal with really big data,\nin a session also fully-occupied to the firemen's discomfort.\n\n\nApparently, to fully appreciate Jordan's deep analyses, one must sometimes trade off some valuable hair:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll things Machine Learning\n\n\nDuring Booth's Orientation, when I told my dear classmates I was into \nMachine Learning\n, \nA.I.\n and \nRobotics\n,\na few pointed me to a wall at Harper Center, where there is a neon contemporary artwork saying (asking?)\nin a kinda dark, haunting way:\n\n\n\n\nWhen I came over to UChicago's Computer Science and Statistics departments to attend lectures and talks,\nand told folks there I was from the b-school, I received identical reception \n\n\ni.e.\n, \"\nWhy [the hell] are you here??!\n\".\n\n\nNeedless to say, my academic and professional paths during this past year have been anything but standard.\nI missed out on a few staples of the MBA life, such as on-campus recruiting, and wandered further afield from\nBooth's Harper Center to spend time at UChicago's various mathematical and technological institutions,\nseeking exotic non-MBA classes.\n\n\nBut I have also ploughed much of my wayward learnings back to Booth,\ntrying to \nmake Machine Learning happen at Booth\n, to bring its cutting-edge benefits\nto the context of modern business operations and management.\nAnd in doing so, I have received warm reception and encouragement from many classmates and faculty members\nin Booth's open, curious and progressive academic environment.\n\n\n\n\nTrial Machine Learning classes for Booth MBA friends\n\n\nIn November 2014, I reached out to invite some Booth friends to try out a 4-week Machine Learning crash course,\nfocusing on \nPredictive Analytics and Pattern Recognition using Neural Networks\n.\nI got lots of help from my long-time pals \nKathy Le\n\nand her husband \nKhoi Nguyen\n \n(give a shout-out to 'em!)\n\nto organize 3-hour Saturday-afternoon classes at Park Millennium's business center. They even volunteered their TV\nfor me to present my materials, as Park Mill's TV was very broken.\n\n\n8 friends joined at the beginning, and 5 went all the way to finish this experimental course.\nWe used a Matlab programming package I'd been coding up for 8 months to run demos on classic\nMachine Learning / Neural Networks use cases in \noptical character recognition\n (\nOCR\n).\nMy friends brought home real, serious homework with \nmultiple-choice questions\n, \nwrite-up questions\n,\na case study on \nGoogle's self-driving cars\n, and \nMatlab programming assignments\n.\nThe course culminated in a ***\nhigh-adrenalin live final competition\n*** in which\neveryone was given 90 minutes to build a Neural Network to rate the quality of bicep curls,\non data collected from fitness tracking devices.\n\n\nMachine Learning class finalists:\n\nKhoi Nguyen\n, \n\nKathy Le\n,\n\nKeith Wagner\n,\n\nEric Cheng\n,\n\nme\n (= warden / referee), and\n\nJuan Yrigoyen\n.\nEveryone in this photo owes a beer to\nEric (Booth Hacks co-chair, Google intern), who tops the final with a\nstunning 99.2% accurate bicep curl quality classification model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOR-REAL, for-credit Machine Learning course for Booth MBAs \n \nWORLD's FIRST of Its Kind!!\n\n\nShortly after I completed the above trial Machine Learning course for my friends with a happy ending,\nI happened to hear from a Machine Learning PhD friend that Booth had just very recently recruited\na young prof named \nMladen Kolar\n,\nwho got his Machine Learning PhD from hot-house Carnegie Mellon and who was a \n1st-batch receiver\nthe Facebook Fellowship\n.\nI immediately fired out an email to Mladen, in a prudently formal-enough tone, but translatable roughly to\n\n\"\nYou're an ML expert... that's cool... and you decided to join Booth... incredible... no way!... WE. MUST. MEET\n!!\"\n\n\nWe met face-to-face in Mladen's Harper Center office suite right before the winter holiday break,\nand I shared with him the excitement and good feedback from my friends whom I'd been teaching Machine Learning to,\nand exchanged thoughts on how we could generalize such feedback to a real demand by Booth MBAs,\nmany of whom are very quant-oriented, for getting our heads around Machine Learning / A.I. and\nbecoming effective business executives in our subsequent careers when we would inevitably have to deal with\nadvanced Data Analytics and technologies powered by Machine Learning algorithms.\n\n\nWe had a couple of further follow-up brain-storming discussions, roping in my fellow Booth MBA\n\nJuan Yrigoyen\n \n(data fanatic and summer SQL-abuser at Amazon)\n\nand then one fine day in Spring 2015, Mladen informed us that he had successfully worked his magic\nwithin what is a very open, progressive and innovative Chicago Booth curriculum-planning system,\nand \n \nthere'd indeed be a Machine Learning course\nspecificially tailored to Booth MBAs\n starting September 2015 \n\nthe \nvery first in the world of its kind\n\nin the curricula of the leading U.S. and international business schools that we know of!!\nSenior professor \nRob McCulloch\n\nand Mladen would co-teach the course, which would feature contents hitherto alien to a b-school audience,\nincluding but certainly not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nEnsemble modeling methods such as Random Forests / Boosting / Bagging,\n\n\nNeural Networks / a primer on Deep Learning,\n\n\nRecommendation Engines,\n\n\nAnomaly Detection in high-dimensional data, and\n\n\nProbabilistic Graphical Models.\n\n\n\n\nThe new offering proved popular with Booth's quant-thirsty populace, with about 100 MBAs signing up.\nMladen and I labored over the summer to build this\n\nshiny website for the course\n,\nand we started rocking-and-rolling at \nEight-Thirty AM, Today, September the Twenty-Forth, Twenty-Fifteen\n!\n\n\nPicture from D-Day:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Scientist / Analytics Product Architect @ disruptive Industrial Internet-of-Things Analytics start-up Uptake, LLC\n\n\nIn late October 2014, barely a month into my MBA program, I saw a two-and-a-half line advertisement about\na Chicago-based analytics start-up named \nUptake\n, written by COO \nJohn Ciasulli\n,\na newly-minted 2014 Booth grad and a VC at \nLightbank\n,\non our Entrepreneurship \n Venture Capital student group's newsletter.\nJohn wrote that Uptake was seeking to use advanced Machine Learning to enhance the efficiency of\nmassive heavy industrial machinery such as freight locomotives and mining trucks,\nwhich sounded really awesome real-world use cases to me.\n\n\nI speculatively emailed John expressing my interest in knowing more, and was delighted when he invited me\nover \"for coffee\" a couple of days later. I did have some nice, strong coffee \n(2 cups)\n,\nand we talked a great deal about what predictive analytics tasks were involved in automating industrial processes,\nand also about the cool quant classes at Booth. John, a Berkeley-trained engineer by background, is himself a fervent\ndata miner and Kaggle.com competitor.\n\n\nJohn emailed me a part-time job offer 2 hours after our coffee chat,\nand with the magical administrative ultra-efficiency that only Booth's Academic Services director\n\nChristine Gramhopfer\n can pull off, less than a week later I got my work authorization\nand found myself at a shared desk at Uptake.\n\n\n\n\nThat was as much of summer internship recruiting as I ever did \n 2 cups of coffee \n\nbecause my part-time role kept getting extended subsequently, all the way until \nyesterday, 2015-09-23\n\n(the very day before school restarts!)\n\n\n\n\nWorking at a fast-growing start-up was like nothing I'd ever done.\nWhen I started in late November, the company was a few months old and had over two dozen employees.\nI joined \nMike Horrell\n and \nZac Schaefer\n, Stats PhD and MSc from UChicago,\nin the initial Data Science setup. We quickly found ourselves swimming in seas of real-world,\nnot-so-pretty to outright-nasty data sets transmitted from a an overwhelming number of industrial sensors\nmeasuring all thinkable kinds of temperatures, pressures, fuel-consumption rates, payload weights,\nthrottle power, wheel rotational speeds, oil and water and coolant levels, chemical levels in liquids,\n\netc. etc. etc.\n, from mammoth-sized locomotives and mining trucks built by Caterpillar Inc., Uptake's first client. \n\n\nA close-up of an engine of a CAT freight locomotive below.\nThere are easily 150-300 sensors hidden all over the place\nand spitting out really Big Data from all that really Big Iron.\n\n\n\n\nCAT builds some truly massive mining trucks \n the kind that roam around Aussie mines\nbringing up metal ores and coal to satisfy the Chinese dragon's thirst for energy and raw materials.\nThe story goes that \nsome trucks are so so gigantic\n (much more than the one shown here)\n\nthat they even have in-built washrooms\n \n\nbecause by the time you manage to walk out of one of those trucks\nkeeping fully compliant with proper industrial safety rules,\nyour urgent piece of \"business\" will be very much done.\nAlso, by the way, when those wheels roll, be very sure to keep good distance!!\n\n\n\n\nIn my total of 10 months at Uptake \n(that was one loooooonnng \"summer\")\n, my main task / specialty was developing\n\nscalable and performant Anomaly Detection algorithms to monitor the health conditions of such data-rich equipment\n.\nAll kinds of theory that I'd acquired through school, through online courses, \netc.\n, became vividly alive.\nI was no longer doing a piece of homework for a good grade, but wrestling with real, messy data\nand trying to get the best possible predictions and recommendations out of those data\nin an acceptable live run-time to enable mechanical engineers on the ground\nto make informed and timely operating decisions. The \ncost, in terms of unplanned expenses and lost business,\nof a big piece of machinery not getting maintained when it should\n, or conversely,\n\ngetting idled for maintenance when it is actually healthy\n, stands in the order of\n\nhundreds of thousands of dollars per asset, per time\n!\n\n\n\n\nSome Poker fun with Machine Learning @ Argonne National Lab / Computation Institute hackathon final\n\n\nNow, onto something more light-hearted, but still involving Machine Learning.\n\n\nIn late November 2014, the \nComputation Institute\n,\na joint UChicago-\nArgonne National Lab\n research house,\nhosted a data hackathon, with the top prize being a brand new 3D printer!\nWith so much other work going on at the same time, I attended not for really competing for anything,\nbut mainly to meet other data pals in UChicago and see what they were up to.\n\n\nThe Final night featured a diverse array of quickly-hacked-together tools targeting at big problems\nfrom crime tracking to health solutions provider recommendation (the latter by Booth's own\npre-eminent hacker \nJake Walker\n, ex-Google / ex-Microsoft,\nCo-Founder of the awesome aforementioned \nBooth Hacks\n,\nand now Co-Founder and CTO of built-at-Booth start-up \nLumii Health\n).\n\n\nI chipped in with some entertainment by presenting a Neural Network that has been trained\nto recognize the \npoker hands\n \n\n\nPair\n, \nTwo Pairs\n, \nThree of a Kind\n, \nStraight\n, \nFlush\n, \nFull House\n, \nFour of a Kind\n and \nStraight Flush\n \n\nto a high level of accuracy. The exercise was mainly for fun, but also illustrated the very real challenges of\n\"\nskewed classes\n\" in training Machine Learning models. A \nStraight Flush\n hand, for instance, is\nabout 30,000 times rarer than a lame \nPair\n, and simplistic algorithms may run for centuries without ever\nfiguring out the \nStraight Flush\n. Poker is a fun way to study this difficult challenge.\n\n\n\n\nBirth of Booth Analytics Club\n\n\nBesides Booth's wonderful quant academic offerings, another factor that made me feel a fish in the water\n(or \n\"a rat in a sack of rice\"\n, as we say it in where I come from)\nat Booth is being surrounded by many classmates that share the same enthusiasm\nfor data and numbers, and who are excited about the applications of modern Data Analytics in today's business.\n\n\nThrough Orientation and various classes and meet-ups, I got to know\n\nSahil Bahri\n,\n\nJuan Yrigoyen\n,\n\nKevin Lam\n,\n\nJaya Kandaswamy\n, and\n\nAmanda Collins\n,\nand who shared the view that Data Analytics had now become a crucial profession\ncutting across multiple industries, and that industries now demanded greater and greater\nAnalytics mastery from business executives than ever before.\nWith Booth's and UChicago's rich quant tradition, it was definitely time to\nbuild at Booth a strong student community around Data Analytics in Business,\nso that we Booth MBAs could go out to various industries and play to our core quant strengths.\n\n\nWith great guidance from our seniors \nAndrew Edelman\n\nand \nRafi Nulman\n,\nwho'd already laid a lot of valuable ground work the year before, we coordinated with Booth's program officers\nto formally launch \nBooth Analytics Club\n in early 2015.\n\n\nOur Club is still young and we have tons of things to have to do going forward,\nbut we are elated with how fast the membership base has been expanding,\nwith the total now standing at about 100 members across Booth's\nFull-Time, Evening and Weekend MBA programs.\n\n\nWe have so far organized:\n\n\n\n\n2 Lunch-and-Learn panels on \nAnalytics in Modern Business\n and \nSurviving Analytics Internships\n,\n\n\nA guest lecture on \nAnalytics onboard Self-Driving Cars\n,\nby who else but my Robotics prof \nMatt Walter\n,\n\n\nA talk on \nAnalytics at IBM\n, and\n\n\nA cosy summer get-together.\n\n\n\n\nWe have also spent weeks and months to construct this wide-ranging\n\nData Science Learning Resources Catalog\n.\n\n\nIn the pipeline for the upcoming Fall-Winter 2015 are:\n\n\n\n\nSQL and Data Visualization crash courses,\n\n\nA Data Science in Python workshop series, and\n\n\nA Data Science Career Resources Catalog.\n\n\n\n\nBooth Analytics Nation, watch out for those exciting things coming!

And,  boy , where, and how has all that year gone? Before I felt like I was anywhere near ready, Chicago Booth  moved me to its 2nd-Year MBAs list,\nwith the school's huge academic buffet feast of brain-hurting classes starting again this very morning.\nOn the family front, Sarah and I are expecting another baby boss within less than six months,\nand hence picturing another tsunami of grueling hard work smashing at us.  So, in the one year now well past, besides acquiring Chicagoan/American tastes such as\nsit-on-the-grass outdoor classical/jazz concerts, thousands of miles of scenic drives,\nand apartments that I'd think be enough for 10 of us back in Singapore,\nwhat have I managed to get done?

            "text": "A irrepressible yearning for going back to school was the reason\nI left  CapitaMalls Asia , a great employer who nurtured my early career\nthrough a dozen fruitful roles in my 6 years with the company.\nAnd once I found myself a schoolboy again, I tried to make the most of the chance.   Online Courses  Before starting at Booth, I took a plethora of  online courses  on  Coursera.com ,\neventually completing a dozen of them. What excited me the most were Coursera's excellent offerings in Machine Learning ,  Artificial Intelligence ,  Robotics  and general Data Science  and  Computer Science .  I'd already taught myself to code in 3-4 computer languages and built a solid foundation in Data Science \nthrough my last 3 years at CapitaMalls, during which I worked on building several Analytics systems to mine\nthe company's increasingly sizeable and commercially important trove of Leasing, Marketing and Operations data.\nBut what Coursera did a tremendous job in was helping me gain a fully up-to-date picture of\nwhere these exciting fields were heading in terms of really advanced technological applications.  Machine Learning involves some hair-raising math:    Chicago Booth and UChicago courses  At Booth, I found myself a fish in the water   or, as we say it in an equivalent Oriental metaphor, \"a rat in a sack of rice\"    with  the school's enormous and uber-flexible curricular offerings .\nNot only there are uncountable exciting courses  (try counting the Finance classes, for which Booth is famous) ,\nthere is a  huge  amount of freedom in crafting one's individualized learning path. By this mid-point in the program,\nI've managed to complete 13 courses, 2/3 of my degree requirement, including the following highlights:     ENTREPRENEURSHIP @ BOOTH :  Entrepreneurial Selling  by serial entrepreneur\n     Craig Wortmann ,\n     Entrepreneurship through Acquisition  by Private Equity/Search Funds veterans\n     Mark Agnew  and\n     Brian O'Connor ,\n    and the ultimate showdown  New Venture Challenge Lab  led by renowned professors\n     Steve Kaplan  and\n     Ellen Rudnick .\n    All are part of Booth's world-beating, already-awesome-and-increasing-so Entrepreneurship curriculum\n    championed by the  Polsky Center , which also runs\n    an impressive  Entrepreneurship Essentials \n    workshop series.    The  New Venture Challenge  was certainly the most intense experience.\nI joined the lab to help out  Keith Wagner \nwith his start-up  Dynamic Positioning Training Solutions ,\na New York-based advanced maritime technological training center.  Team  Maestro  topped the 2015 NVC with a smart cooking appliance\n    and a Final pitch of stylishness and meticulous execution bordering on pure theater:     In my upcoming 2nd year, I am back for more Entrep goodness in  Building the New Venture  by Waverly Deutsch       DATA-INTENSIVE COURSES   \noodles of them available, to my heart's delight   in what is the quantitative paradises\nthat are Booth and UChicago. At Booth, I took  Big Data  by rising star Matt Taddy .   For the final project, I made a fairly creditable attempt at tackling this very big and very wild driving telematics tracking data set on Kaggle.com \nhosted by insurance giant AXA, who challenged Kaggle competitors to detect individual driving styles from\nhigh-frequency series of location coordinates streamed from vehicle-mounted accelerometers.\nBelow were plots showing individual drivers' highly characteristic\naccelerating and turning behaviors detected by my pattern-recognition algorithms:     Another quant must-try was  Machine Learning   Large-Scale Data Analysis \nby UChicago's leading Machine Learning guru  John Lafferty \n(more on him  below ). His course was a sweeping survey with head-cracking math and\nliterally astronomical data sets  (e.g. characteristic light curves from dozens of thousands of planets and stars) .  Lafferty's homework featured undoubtedly astronomical data transmitted from the Kepler space telescope:        SCIENCE / TECH COURSES  in UChicago:\nBooth's flexible curriculum enables me to try out great offerings elsewhere at UChicago's\ndiverse departments and member research institutions. \nMy hands-down favorite was  Robotics   Artificial Intelligence  by Matt Walter ,\na UIUC- and MIT-trained roboticist and one of the builders of the MIT Self-Driving Car, which\nfinished in the top 5 in  DARPA's famous 2007 Urban Challenge .    My final Robotics programming project, perfectly timed shortly before the European (Soccer) Cup final,\nwas this  RoboSoccer game ,\nemploying an algorithm called  \"Extended Kalman Filter-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\" (EKF SLAM) .\nHere is my  entire paper  on this game  for your reading pleasure.  My bots basically locate and orient themselves on the field by estimating their distances from various landmarks,\n    e.g. goal posts and corner flags; they then try chase the pink ball and kick it towards the goal.\n     CLICK \n    the below image to see a live match:   But that triumphal end only came after I barely survived\nthis below sad, sick, total-terror Robo reading list,\nwhich is written in as many Greek symbols as English characters...      I also got a taste of  Computer Vision  from Sam Armato  and Maryellen Giger ,\nseasoned scientists who have been spending many decades developing\nautomated visual analysis technologies for advanced medical equipment.   I presented a brief paper outlining my thoughts on\nhow the same Computer Vision techniques may be used by drones to\nautomate visual inspection of mechanical faults in highly hazardous environments, e.g.  near oil or natural gas pipelines    Because both profs are medical doctors, they gave us this chest X-ray\nto play around with in mathematical / scientific ways, for 10 weeks...\nHey, why not a real-, fleshy-chest photo to motivate students better??

            "text": "During Booth's Orientation, when I told my dear classmates I was into  Machine Learning ,  A.I.  and  Robotics ,\na few pointed me to a wall at Harper Center, where there is a neon contemporary artwork saying (asking?)\nin a kinda dark, haunting way:   When I came over to UChicago's Computer Science and Statistics departments to attend lectures and talks,\nand told folks there I was from the b-school, I received identical reception   i.e. , \" Why [the hell] are you here??! \".  Needless to say, my academic and professional paths during this past year have been anything but standard.\nI missed out on a few staples of the MBA life, such as on-campus recruiting, and wandered further afield from\nBooth's Harper Center to spend time at UChicago's various mathematical and technological institutions,\nseeking exotic non-MBA classes.  But I have also ploughed much of my wayward learnings back to Booth,\ntrying to  make Machine Learning happen at Booth , to bring its cutting-edge benefits\nto the context of modern business operations and management.\nAnd in doing so, I have received warm reception and encouragement from many classmates and faculty members\nin Booth's open, curious and progressive academic environment.   Trial Machine Learning classes for Booth MBA friends  In November 2014, I reached out to invite some Booth friends to try out a 4-week Machine Learning crash course,\nfocusing on  Predictive Analytics and Pattern Recognition using Neural Networks .\nI got lots of help from my long-time pals  Kathy Le \nand her husband  Khoi Nguyen   (give a shout-out to 'em!) \nto organize 3-hour Saturday-afternoon classes at Park Millennium's business center. They even volunteered their TV\nfor me to present my materials, as Park Mill's TV was very broken.  8 friends joined at the beginning, and 5 went all the way to finish this experimental course.\nWe used a Matlab programming package I'd been coding up for 8 months to run demos on classic\nMachine Learning / Neural Networks use cases in  optical character recognition  ( OCR ).\nMy friends brought home real, serious homework with  multiple-choice questions ,  write-up questions ,\na case study on  Google's self-driving cars , and  Matlab programming assignments .\nThe course culminated in a *** high-adrenalin live final competition *** in which\neveryone was given 90 minutes to build a Neural Network to rate the quality of bicep curls,\non data collected from fitness tracking devices.  Machine Learning class finalists: Khoi Nguyen ,  Kathy Le , Keith Wagner , Eric Cheng , me  (= warden / referee), and Juan Yrigoyen .\nEveryone in this photo owes a beer to\nEric (Booth Hacks co-chair, Google intern), who tops the final with a\nstunning 99.2% accurate bicep curl quality classification model:    FOR-REAL, for-credit Machine Learning course for Booth MBAs    WORLD's FIRST of Its Kind!!  Shortly after I completed the above trial Machine Learning course for my friends with a happy ending,\nI happened to hear from a Machine Learning PhD friend that Booth had just very recently recruited\na young prof named  Mladen Kolar ,\nwho got his Machine Learning PhD from hot-house Carnegie Mellon and who was a  1st-batch receiver\nthe Facebook Fellowship .\nI immediately fired out an email to Mladen, in a prudently formal-enough tone, but translatable roughly to \" You're an ML expert... that's cool... and you decided to join Booth... incredible... no way!... WE. MUST. MEET !!\"  We met face-to-face in Mladen's Harper Center office suite right before the winter holiday break,\nand I shared with him the excitement and good feedback from my friends whom I'd been teaching Machine Learning to,\nand exchanged thoughts on how we could generalize such feedback to a real demand by Booth MBAs,\nmany of whom are very quant-oriented, for getting our heads around Machine Learning / A.I. and\nbecoming effective business executives in our subsequent careers when we would inevitably have to deal with\nadvanced Data Analytics and technologies powered by Machine Learning algorithms.  We had a couple of further follow-up brain-storming discussions, roping in my fellow Booth MBA Juan Yrigoyen   (data fanatic and summer SQL-abuser at Amazon) \nand then one fine day in Spring 2015, Mladen informed us that he had successfully worked his magic\nwithin what is a very open, progressive and innovative Chicago Booth curriculum-planning system,\nand    there'd indeed be a Machine Learning course\nspecificially tailored to Booth MBAs  starting September 2015  \nthe  very first in the world of its kind \nin the curricula of the leading U.S. and international business schools that we know of!!\nSenior professor  Rob McCulloch \nand Mladen would co-teach the course, which would feature contents hitherto alien to a b-school audience,\nincluding but certainly not limited to:   Ensemble modeling methods such as Random Forests / Boosting / Bagging,  Neural Networks / a primer on Deep Learning,  Recommendation Engines,  Anomaly Detection in high-dimensional data, and  Probabilistic Graphical Models.   The new offering proved popular with Booth's quant-thirsty populace, with about 100 MBAs signing up.\nMladen and I labored over the summer to build this shiny website for the course ,\nand we started rocking-and-rolling at  Eight-Thirty AM, Today, September the Twenty-Forth, Twenty-Fifteen !  Picture from D-Day:     Data Scientist / Analytics Product Architect @ disruptive Industrial Internet-of-Things Analytics start-up Uptake, LLC  In late October 2014, barely a month into my MBA program, I saw a two-and-a-half line advertisement about\na Chicago-based analytics start-up named  Uptake , written by COO  John Ciasulli ,\na newly-minted 2014 Booth grad and a VC at  Lightbank ,\non our Entrepreneurship   Venture Capital student group's newsletter.\nJohn wrote that Uptake was seeking to use advanced Machine Learning to enhance the efficiency of\nmassive heavy industrial machinery such as freight locomotives and mining trucks,\nwhich sounded really awesome real-world use cases to me.  I speculatively emailed John expressing my interest in knowing more, and was delighted when he invited me\nover \"for coffee\" a couple of days later. I did have some nice, strong coffee  (2 cups) ,\nand we talked a great deal about what predictive analytics tasks were involved in automating industrial processes,\nand also about the cool quant classes at Booth. John, a Berkeley-trained engineer by background, is himself a fervent\ndata miner and Kaggle.com competitor.  John emailed me a part-time job offer 2 hours after our coffee chat,\nand with the magical administrative ultra-efficiency that only Booth's Academic Services director Christine Gramhopfer  can pull off, less than a week later I got my work authorization\nand found myself at a shared desk at Uptake.   That was as much of summer internship recruiting as I ever did   2 cups of coffee  \nbecause my part-time role kept getting extended subsequently, all the way until  yesterday, 2015-09-23 \n(the very day before school restarts!)   Working at a fast-growing start-up was like nothing I'd ever done.\nWhen I started in late November, the company was a few months old and had over two dozen employees.\nI joined  Mike Horrell  and  Zac Schaefer , Stats PhD and MSc from UChicago,\nin the initial Data Science setup. We quickly found ourselves swimming in seas of real-world,\nnot-so-pretty to outright-nasty data sets transmitted from a an overwhelming number of industrial sensors\nmeasuring all thinkable kinds of temperatures, pressures, fuel-consumption rates, payload weights,\nthrottle power, wheel rotational speeds, oil and water and coolant levels, chemical levels in liquids, etc. etc. etc. , from mammoth-sized locomotives and mining trucks built by Caterpillar Inc., Uptake's first client.   A close-up of an engine of a CAT freight locomotive below.\nThere are easily 150-300 sensors hidden all over the place\nand spitting out really Big Data from all that really Big Iron.   CAT builds some truly massive mining trucks   the kind that roam around Aussie mines\nbringing up metal ores and coal to satisfy the Chinese dragon's thirst for energy and raw materials.\nThe story goes that  some trucks are so so gigantic  (much more than the one shown here) that they even have in-built washrooms   \nbecause by the time you manage to walk out of one of those trucks\nkeeping fully compliant with proper industrial safety rules,\nyour urgent piece of \"business\" will be very much done.\nAlso, by the way, when those wheels roll, be very sure to keep good distance!!   In my total of 10 months at Uptake  (that was one loooooonnng \"summer\") , my main task / specialty was developing scalable and performant Anomaly Detection algorithms to monitor the health conditions of such data-rich equipment .\nAll kinds of theory that I'd acquired through school, through online courses,  etc. , became vividly alive.\nI was no longer doing a piece of homework for a good grade, but wrestling with real, messy data\nand trying to get the best possible predictions and recommendations out of those data\nin an acceptable live run-time to enable mechanical engineers on the ground\nto make informed and timely operating decisions. The  cost, in terms of unplanned expenses and lost business,\nof a big piece of machinery not getting maintained when it should , or conversely, getting idled for maintenance when it is actually healthy , stands in the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars per asset, per time !   Some Poker fun with Machine Learning @ Argonne National Lab / Computation Institute hackathon final  Now, onto something more light-hearted, but still involving Machine Learning.  In late November 2014, the  Computation Institute ,\na joint UChicago- Argonne National Lab  research house,\nhosted a data hackathon, with the top prize being a brand new 3D printer!\nWith so much other work going on at the same time, I attended not for really competing for anything,\nbut mainly to meet other data pals in UChicago and see what they were up to.  The Final night featured a diverse array of quickly-hacked-together tools targeting at big problems\nfrom crime tracking to health solutions provider recommendation (the latter by Booth's own\npre-eminent hacker  Jake Walker , ex-Google / ex-Microsoft,\nCo-Founder of the awesome aforementioned  Booth Hacks ,\nand now Co-Founder and CTO of built-at-Booth start-up  Lumii Health ).  I chipped in with some entertainment by presenting a Neural Network that has been trained\nto recognize the  poker hands    Pair ,  Two Pairs ,  Three of a Kind ,  Straight ,  Flush ,  Full House ,  Four of a Kind  and  Straight Flush   \nto a high level of accuracy. The exercise was mainly for fun, but also illustrated the very real challenges of\n\" skewed classes \" in training Machine Learning models. A  Straight Flush  hand, for instance, is\nabout 30,000 times rarer than a lame  Pair , and simplistic algorithms may run for centuries without ever\nfiguring out the  Straight Flush . Poker is a fun way to study this difficult challenge.",

Through Orientation and various classes and meet-ups, I got to know Sahil Bahri , Juan Yrigoyen , Kevin Lam , Jaya Kandaswamy , and Amanda Collins ,\nand who shared the view that Data Analytics had now become a crucial profession\ncutting across multiple industries, and that industries now demanded greater and greater\nAnalytics mastery from business executives than ever before.\nWith Booth's and UChicago's rich quant tradition, it was definitely time to\nbuild at Booth a strong student community around Data Analytics in Business,\nso that we Booth MBAs could go out to various industries and play to our core quant strengths.  With great guidance from our seniors  Andrew Edelman \nand  Rafi Nulman ,\nwho'd already laid a lot of valuable ground work the year before, we coordinated with Booth's program officers\nto formally launch  Booth Analytics Club  in early 2015.  Our Club is still young and we have tons of things to have to do going forward,\nbut we are elated with how fast the membership base has been expanding,\nwith the total now standing at about 100 members across Booth's\nFull-Time, Evening and Weekend MBA programs.  We have so far organized:   2 Lunch-and-Learn panels on  Analytics in Modern Business  and  Surviving Analytics Internships ,  A guest lecture on  Analytics onboard Self-Driving Cars ,\nby who else but my Robotics prof  Matt Walter ,  A talk on  Analytics at IBM , and  A cosy summer get-together.   We have also spent weeks and months to construct this wide-ranging Data Science Learning Resources Catalog .  In the pipeline for the upcoming Fall-Winter 2015 are:   SQL and Data Visualization crash courses,  A Data Science in Python workshop series, and  A Data Science Career Resources Catalog.
